/**
 * @class MovementModel
 *
 * @brief Templated interface for movement models for particle filters.
 *
 * The movement model in a particle filter defines how a particle's state
 * changes over time. It is used in the drift and diffuse step of
 * particle_filter::ParticleFilter (strategy pattern). To define a movement
 * model, create a sub-class of this class and implement the drift() method. A
 * particle filter with this movement model applies the drift method for each
 * particle in each filter step. Also you have to implement the function
 * diffuse() to define a jitter that is added to a state after drift() (which
 * may be empty of course). You can use the function randomGauss() to obtain
 * Gaussian-distributed random variables.
